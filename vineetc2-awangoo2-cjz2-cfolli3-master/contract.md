# CS225 Data Structures Team Contract (cfolli3 - cjz2 - vineetc2 - awangoo2)

**Communication**

1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once every Monday at 3:30 to at least 5:00 pm using Zoom. Members will be encouraged to come to the meeting with an idea of the topic at hand and will most likely be briefly talked about in a messaging group. For note taking, whoever is handling the weekly development log for that week will be taking notes during the meetings. Assistance

2. **Respect Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email, commenting on a Google Doc, or via iMessage. We aim to be able to answer emails within 48 hours, and be able to respond to each other via text within 24 hours. In addition, group members are encouraged to reach out to each other for help with their portions of the project. 

3. **Collaboration Group** members are expected to have a mutual respect for each other and understanding for each other’s time and work. All decisions on the project should be discussed and constructive criticism is very much welcome. In addition, during meetings, it is required that all members say their opinion on a decision at least once per meeting. 

**Collaboration**

1. **Work Distribution** Work will be distributed weekly at our weekly meetings, playing to each member's strengths and weaknesses. Depending on how difficult the task is, we will also allocate more than one person per task. Time Commitment

2. **Time Commitment**Group members are expected to work on the project for at least 4 hours a week, or until their portion of the project is completed and fully functioning and confirmed by another group member. Should a team member be unable to commit enough time for that week, they are encouraged to inform the other team members of time constraints. Conflict Resolution

3. **Time Commitment** Should any egregious conflict arise between group members, they are encouraged to inform the other members not involved in said conflict which they would come to a decision to settle between the two. However, if there is a conflict between all four members, the team’s mentor will be contacted on their decision on the matter. If the mentor is unavailable within a 24 hour time period, a virtual coin will be flipped via google on a zoom call.
